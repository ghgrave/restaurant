This school project was my first attempt at combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from all the smaller projects I had worked on over 
the previous six weeks. 

This comes with no previous experience and being self-taught in that all projects were given a list of requirements and then up 
to me to include however I saw fit. This was all done online with no in-class or peer discussions. I received no feedback from 
professor and was the first student to complete all projects; I was able to finish the class within eight weeks (a 16 week 
course)and received an A.

Pages were designed using a public domain 50's restaurant drawing which was submitted to http://pictaculous.com for a color 
evaluation. All colors used on pages derived from this palette.

With no experience in web design, this project required me to not only use required text books, but a lot of outside research 
and experimentation. Learned quite a bit about Google and Stack Overflow.
